# Simple Twitter Clone Frontend - Vue

This is a pre-requisite assignment (frontend part) to be completed before starting actual development at [Yocket](https://yocket.com/).

### Technologies used

- Vue.js for building web user-interfaces
- `vue-router` for routing
- Tailwind CSS for designing
- VSCode for code editor
- Eslint Prettier for linting & formatting code

### UI features according to api endpoints

- signup
- signin
- view tweets
- create tweet
- view user
- follow user

### Limitations

- UI/UX is not focused as this assignment was only to get hands-on of Vue.js.
- Only basic UI are created just to consume api endpoints.
